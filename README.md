Social Media Buttons
====================

Built for use in conjunction with Bootstrap and FontAwesome, this project will produce wonderful site-specific colored styles for social media icons. There are three different mixins developed under this project. The colors or background colors will change according to the brand icon used (see http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ for full list)

1. Square (default)
3. Circle

Default styles will be applied when used as follows

  a href="fa fa-facebook"
  
Square styles will be applied when used as follows

  a href="fa fa-facebook social"
  
Circle styles will be applied when used as follows

  a href="fa fa-facebook social circle"
