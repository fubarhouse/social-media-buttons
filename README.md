Social Media Buttons
====================

Built for use in conjunction with Bootstrap and FontAwesome, this project will produce wonderful site-specific colored styles for social media icons. There are three different mixins developed under this project.

1. Default (none)
2. Square
3. Circle

Default styles will be applied when used as follows
<code><a href="fa fa-facebook"></a></code>
Square styles will be applied when used as follows
<code><a href="fa fa-facebook square"></a></code>
Circle styles will be applied when used as follows
<code><a href="fa fa-facebook circle"></a></code>
